This project is a free initiative to create an Arduino library for temperature sensors. 
The main goal is to provide a library that simplifies the usage of this particular sensor in Arduino projects.

Currently the following sensor is supported:
 * TMP36

## Library Usage
 * Download the source
 * Place the TemperatureTMP folder in your Arduino1.0+ "libraries" folder
 * Open example sketch: "file", "Examples", "TemperatureTMP", "Temperature" (or "!RawData")
 * Connect the analog sensor to port A0 (and connect Vcc and GND)
 * Compile & upload code
 * Sensor data should be arriving over the serial port
